/*Exercise 1: This problem, we would like to study a sorting algorithm for a given
array of n elements with the following steps: 
1. Find the maximum element position(denoted by max) from 0 to n-1. 
2. Flip all elements from the position 0 to max.(Flip means reverse, e.g: flipping (1, 0, 3) = (3, 0, 1)).
3. Flip the whole unsorted array. Now the maximum is found at the end of the unsorted array and the last
element or the maximum is sorted. 
4. Repeat this process until all elements aresorted.
Write a program to complete the above algorithm.
Calculate the complexity of your program (Best scenario, Worst scenario, Average).*/
