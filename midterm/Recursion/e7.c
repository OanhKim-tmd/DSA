// /*Question 1: (12pts)
// In this problem, we check whether a sum of a given natural number and its reverse is
// palindromic or not. A number is palindromic if it remains the same when its digits are reversed.
// For example:
// N = 56 and its reverse = 65, their sum is 121 = palindromic
// N = 132 and its reverse = 231, their sum is 363 = palindromic
// N = 605 and its reverse = 506, their sum is 1111 = palindromic
// ▪ Propose and implement a recursive function to solve the above problem. (8pts)
// ▪ Calculate the complexity of the proposed algorithm. (2pts)
// ▪ Propose a method to optimize the checking process. Justify your answer. (2pts)*/
