/*Problem:
Given a positive natural number N = 3450, we would like to study numbers by:
- Count the number of odd, even digits of N. Note that 0 is even.
Example:
- The number of odd digits of N = 3450 is 2 with odd digits = {3, 5};
- The number of even digits of N = 3450 is 2 with even digits = {4, 0}.
-
Question 1: (12 pts)
 Propose only one pseudo-code function to count the number of odd and even digits of N. (2
pts)
 Implement the proposed function (only one function) that returns the number of odd and even
digits at the same time using Pass-by-Reference in C/C++. (8pts)
 Calculate the complexity of your program (Best scenario, Worst scenario, Average). Justify
your answer. (2 pts)
