/*Exercise 1:
Suppose we would like to implement a queue system for a commercial website.
Given that the website offers a list of items, each item has a limited quantity in
stock. Implement a queue of customers, and each customer can buy only a few
products among the available items.
 Determine the item name, quantity, and price in stock.
 Specify a queue of n customers; each customer can buy k products from one
item (k is different for each customer).
 Customers take turns to enter (enqueue) and leave (dequeue) the queue according to the FIFO order to purchase wanted products.
 If a customer successfully purchases products, display a message and reduce
the number of products in stock. Otherwise, display a warning message if the
item has been run out.
Implement the above problems in C/C++ using a Queue data structure. Write
a main function for testing all written functions (init(), display(), enqueue(), dequeue(),...).*/
