Exercise 2: Assume that a railway train has N railroad cars attached together
such as car1, car2, car3, ..., carN . A train can be considered as a list and each car
corresponds to a node in this list.
1
   - Each car carries a maximum capacity of passengers (int type) and has an id
(char type). Both variables are user-defined values.
   - Each car is reserved by a number of passengers (int type) (which should be
less than its capacity). If there are any cars that don’t have any passengers,
they should be removed from the train.
   - It is possible to add new cars to the train.
   - A function is available to display all cars’ information or the length of the
train.
Implement a program in C/C++ using Linked List to manage the train and test all
functions.*/
